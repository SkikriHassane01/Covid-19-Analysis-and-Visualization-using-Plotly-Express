# COVID-19 Analysis using Plotly Express

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data and visualize it using Plotly Express in Python. It includes various statistical and graphical representations to better understand the global impact of the pandemic. The project generates high-quality bar charts, choropleth maps, scatter plots, and bubble charts to provide a comprehensive view of the pandemic’s spread, severity, and testing efforts worldwide.

Through data visualization, we can simplify complex information, observe patterns, and make informed predictions about the future trajectory of COVID-19. This analysis provides insights into infection trends, mortality rates, testing efforts, and regional disparities, helping policymakers and researchers understand the pandemic's dynamics and management strategies.

## Objectives
This project summarizes modeling, simulation, and analytical work related to the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide. It examines the impact of preventive measures and best practices across different countries and regions. The visualization techniques used in this project allow for:

✅ Understanding the pandemic's spread across different countries and continents.  
✅ Identifying the most affected countries and analyzing key trends.  
✅ Examining the correlation between cases and deaths to assess outbreak severity.  
✅ Evaluating testing efficiency across different nations.

## Key Analyses & Visualizations

### 1️⃣ Global COVID-19 Cases & Deaths Map
📌 **Visualization Type:** Choropleth Map  
🔹 A world map highlighting total COVID-19 cases and deaths by country.  
🔹 Identifies countries with the highest reported cases and fatalities.  
🔹 Color-coded for better visual representation of the pandemic’s impact.  

### 2️⃣ Top 10 Countries with Highest Cases & Deaths
📌 **Visualization Type:** Bar Chart  
🔹 Displays the top 10 worst-affected countries in terms of total cases and deaths.  
🔹 Helps in comparing the impact of COVID-19 across the hardest-hit nations.  

### 3️⃣ Cases vs. Deaths Correlation
📌 **Visualization Type:** Scatter Plot  
🔹 Examines the relationship between total cases and total deaths.  
🔹 Determines whether a higher number of cases always results in more deaths.  
🔹 Provides insight into mortality rates and how different countries are managing fatalities.  

### 4️⃣ COVID-19 Impact by Continent
📌 **Visualization Type:** Grouped Bar Chart  
🔹 Compares total cases, deaths, and recoveries across different continents.  
🔹 Highlights regional variations and how different continents have handled the outbreak.  

### 5️⃣ Testing vs. Cases Analysis
📌 **Visualization Type:** Scatter Plot  
🔹 Compares the total number of tests conducted vs. total cases recorded in each country.  
🔹 Assesses whether increased testing leads to more cases being detected.  
🔹 Provides insights into testing efficiency and health system preparedness.
